# Challenge
# Dot already has a few seeds they can use for their garden. They need to figure out which of the seeds will produce
# the biggest potential harvest. Can you help Dot decide which seeds are best, by using data visualization?
#
# Create a bar graph with Matplotlib that shows each vegetable and the size of the potential harvest
# that Dot can expect from them.
#
# Which of Dot's seeds will produce the largest harvest?
