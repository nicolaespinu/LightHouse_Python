# Challenge
# Dot has some specific rules for what they want to change in the shopping list:
#
# They hate oak wood, and prefer maple.
# They want to paint all the rooms blue except the kitchen, which they want to paint white.
old_blueprint = {
    "Kitchen": ['Dirty', 'Oak', "Damaged", "Green"],
    "Dining Room": ['Dirty', 'Pine', 'Good Condition', 'Grey'],
    "Living Room": ['Dirty', 'Oak', 'Damaged', 'Red'],
    "Bedroom" : ["Clean", 'Mahogany', 'Good Condition', 'Green'],
    "Bathroom": ["Dirty", 'White Tile', 'Good Condition','White'],
    "Shed"    : ['Dirty', "Cherry", "Damaged", "Un-painted"]
}

shopping_list = ['20 x Oak Plank', '20 x Oak Plank', '20 x Cherry Plank', 'White Paint', 'White Paint', 'White Paint']
# Note: The blueprint above is in a dictionary format and we won't be needing to work with dictionaries
# in the challenge, use the blueprint as reference only.
#
# Use python's pop(), insert(), and append() list functions to change the shopping_list above so that it reflects
# the right materials needed.
#
# The list should be ordered by wood types first, then paint types.

example_shopping_list = ['wood type in room A', 'wood type in room b','paint type in room a','paint type in room b']
# Create a paint_list list from the new_shopping_list list using the built in python list indexing ability.
shopping_list = ['20 x Oak plank', '20 x Oak Plank', '20 x Cherry Plank', 'White Paint', 'White Paint', 'White Paint']
#Solution
